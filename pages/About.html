                <h3>History of the Game</h3>
                <p>The original Japan release of Super Smash Bros (64) occured in the January of 1999. An alternative that is both sillier and allowed more simultaneous players than the supergiants of the stagnating 2D fighters genre. Immense success in Japan prompted a worldwide release of the game. After the release of the gamecube Nintendo released a sequel - Super Smash Bros Melee - eventually becoming the best selling game on the console. Since then there has been a release every new console generation. Information from Wikipedia. </p>

                <h3>What Made it Successful</h3>
                <p>The wide adoption of super smash bros can be attributed to a variety of factors, quite frankly the game has a lot going for it. From the onset Super Smash leveraged one of the core things Ninentendo did well, memorable characters. Being able to pick between video game all stars such as mario, samus, and pikachu instantly drew people to the game. Coupling that fact with the lack of gore, death, and a general sense of casual/cartoonish violence meant the mutiplayer game also became instantly popuar among younger children.</p>
